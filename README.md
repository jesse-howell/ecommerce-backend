# ecommerce-backend

## Description

This project was built to understand and demonstrate the workings of a MySQL database for an online store. It's functionality is based on CRUD concepts which easily allows the user to update their inventory. This a simple backend that can easily scale depending on the size of the store's inventory. Through my work on this project I learned the functionality of modern e-commerce sites. While working on this project, I was able to mentally map the frontend display to the backend functionality which helped me understand the routes in greater detail.
